        <p>  Barbifa, an Expert in going abroad to study says, you should go abroad! It looks very good on your CV and you can get better in another language. Taking some courses can get you some very good experience in your CV! The expert says that the ideal time would be something around 3 months or more because you would have time to practice the language and get more knowledge in the course 
        </p>
        <p>She also said that going abroad to study is very good to gain independence and learn more about yourself. When you go abroad you need to learn how to start from zero, no friends, no job, no family. So you need to go out of your confort zone to do all of that. That's is great for gaining independence. And by leaving alone, you start to meditate about what it is important for you </p>

        <p>Bfafe1 believes that is not good for you to go abroad if you have SERIOUS money issues because it costs a lot and if you have just enough to survive it could be very dangerous. Especially if going abroad to countries that donâ€™t offer public hospitals. She also believes if you are a person who feels homesick very easily, even on short trips, going abroad probably will get you into depression.</p>
        <p> Another reason to dont go abroad is if you have fear os mission out. A lot of exchange students just look at their family and friends photos on instagran and just wish they were there. This is very bad for their mental health. This can cause anxiety and depression.</p>
